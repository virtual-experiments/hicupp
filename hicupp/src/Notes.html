<h1>HiCuPP Release July 4th, 2002</h1>
<p>Author: <a href="mailto:bart.jacobs@cs.kuleuven.ac.be">Bart Jacobs</a>.</p>
<h2>New In This Release</h2>
<p>This release fixes a problem with the node popup menu when the program is run
in Windows XP. In the previous release, a java.awt.PopupMenu object is created
and added to the tree document
after the user clicks the mouse on the node. In the current release, the
PopupMenu object is created and added to the tree document
once when the TreeDocument is constructed.</p>
<h2>How To Build The Executables</h2>
<p>The classes in this release support three programs:</p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Main Class</b></td><td><b>Executable Name</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>hicupp.SequentialHicupp</td><td>SeCuPPBeta15.exe</td></tr>
<tr><td>interactivehicupp.ImagesMain</td><td>InteractiveHicuppForImagesBeta16.exe</td></tr>
<tr><td>interactivehicupp.GeneralMain</td><td>InteractiveHicuppForGeneralPointSetsBeta16.exe</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Structure Of The Source Code</h2>
<h3>Package Jama</h3>
<p>Jama is a library for manipulating matrices which I downloaded from the Internet.
It is used by classes in the hicupp package for computing the split axis.</p>
<h3>Package imageformats</h3>
<p>These classes are used by the hicupp and interactivehicupp packages to load
the images selected for segmentation by the user.</p>
<h3>Package hicupp</h3>
<p>Contains the classes that actually compute the split axis. The main class for the
computation is hicupp.Clusterer. This package also contains the user interface
for sequential hicupp.</p>
<p>The projection indices are defined in hicupp.ProjectionIndexFunction. It should be
easy to add new projection indices there. When done correctly, new projection indices
automatically show up in the user interface.</p>
<p>The hicupp.FunctionMaximizer class implements the simplex algorithm.</p>
<h3>Package interactivehicupp</h3>
<p>The structure of this package is somewhat complicated. This is mainly due to the
effort to share as much code as possible between Hicupp for Images and Hicupp for
General Point Sets.</p>
<p>The DocumentXXX classes implement generic document management: opening and saving
documents. The TreeDocumentXXX classes instantiate the general document concept for
so-called tree documents, which are the hierarchical clusterings. A tree document
consists of a number of nodes and a number of splits. There is one root node, and each
node has zero or one split. Each split has a left child node and a right child node.</p>
<p>The main difference between HiCuPP for Images and HiCuPP for General Point Sets is
where the points come from: in the former case, they come from bitmap files, and in
the latter case, they come from ASCII files. Therefore, I have factored out
the concept of PointsSource. There is an ImagePointsSourceProvider and a
GeneralPointsSourceProvider. Since there is a need for two-way communication between
the PointsSourceProvider and the TreeDocument, the TreeDocument implements the
PointsSourceClient interface.</p>
